                My name is Armen Mardirossian and I am an experienced web developer. In a short story, I would like to tell you how I became a full stack web developer with no degree in computer science, and give the beginners some advice that will help them throughout their journey.             </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2015 as a pre-law student who interned at Human Rights Watch. I was excited and ready to start my journey towards a law degree; however, I needed a job to pay off my loan. I sought the help of a staffing company to find me a suitable job related to law; however, after a long search I was hired for a position described as legal assistant in an international media company. Little did I know my main job would turn to be providing online cybersecurity services for the media organization around the world. I was almost working in the tech industry with no prior experience. At the time, I was only focusing on getting into law school and becoming a lawyer. At the time, my plan never involved pursuing software development.            </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                Sometime later, I received an offer from another media company that operated internationally on a smaller scale. At that point in time, I was ready to dive deeper into the media field in the media field while pursuing law school. After many attempts on taking the LSAT, I was finally ready to study a topic that interested me. With my prior work experience, I could not only be a great asset to a company, but could later add value to the organization in the long run. On August 2019, I graduated from USC with master of science degree in Project Management with no coding background. While working and trying to make my next move, I found myself on a crossroad.             </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                The Covid-19 pandemic affected my life both in a negative, and positive a way. I was laid off when the pandemic first began. After that, all I did was aggressively apply to any company with a job listing. After many days spent researching, I realized a skill I can learn that will help me not only in the present, but also in the future would be software engineering. Since I had no experience in programming, I decided to seek advice from professionals. Contacting people in the field seemed like the most reasonable thing to do. I wanted to know if taking this path could eventually lead me to my dream job. I spoke with professionals at Google and smaller companies. I never asked them for a job, even though that was the most important thing I needed during that time. Luckily, I received a warm welcome from many of them to start my journey as a software developer. I was very motivated by their positive approach. I learned that if I don’t have a computer science background, I’m only left with two options; signing up for a bootcamp or being a self-taught programmer. So, I did more research.
