                        for over 15 years. I'm a full-stack engineer
                        specializing in <span class="nobreak">Generative Deep Learning.</span>

                        I use to teach for UC Berkeley, but later founded
                        Coding Catalyst to teach students how to code.

                My name is Armen Mardirossian and I am an experienced web developer. In a short story, I would like to tell you how I became a full stack web developer with no degree in computer science, and give the beginners some advice that will help them throughout their journey.             </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2015 as a pre-law student who interned at Human Rights Watch. I was excited and ready to start my journey towards a law degree; however, I needed a job to pay off my loan. I sought the help of a staffing company to find me a suitable job related to law; however, after a long search I was hired for a position described as legal assistant in an international media company. Little did I know my main job would turn to be providing online cybersecurity services for the media organization around the world. I was almost working in the tech industry with no prior experience. At the time, I was only focusing on getting into law school and becoming a lawyer. At the time, my plan never involved pursuing software development.            </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                Sometime later, I received an offer from another media company that operated internationally on a smaller scale. At that point in time, I was ready to dive deeper into the media field in the media field while pursuing law school. After many attempts on taking the LSAT, I was finally ready to study a topic that interested me. With my prior work experience, I could not only be a great asset to a company, but could later add value to the organization in the long run. On August 2019, I graduated from USC with master of science degree in Project Management with no coding background. While working and trying to make my next move, I found myself on a crossroad.             </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                The Covid-19 pandemic affected my life both in a negative, and positive a way. I was laid off when the pandemic first began. After that, all I did was aggressively apply to any company with a job listing. After many days spent researching, I realized a skill I can learn that will help me not only in the present, but also in the future would be software engineering. Since I had no experience in programming, I decided to seek advice from professionals. Contacting people in the field seemed like the most reasonable thing to do. I wanted to know if taking this path could eventually lead me to my dream job. I spoke with professionals at Google and smaller companies. I never asked them for a job, even though that was the most important thing I needed during that time. Luckily, I received a warm welcome from many of them to start my journey as a software developer. I was very motivated by their positive approach. I learned that if I don’t have a computer science background, I’m only left with two options; signing up for a bootcamp or being a self-taught programmer. So, I did more research.
            </p>
            <p class="post-description">
                I started researching more about Cory Althoff, who was a self-taught programmer. His book was very helpful in strategizing and providing some guidance in my journey. I also spoke with Angel Contreras, also a self-taught software developer, who worked at Live Nation. He explained that his journey started from an internship which then lead him to study all the material by himself. I was inspired by the journeys of these two self-taught programmers. I signed up for a Udemy course and looked for online materials while doing my research on the job market to try and learn to try and learn what skills were on demand. After a while, I knew that these materials are too foreign to me. It was as if I was learning an alien language. Therefore, I decided to search for institutions that teach programming. One of my former classmates who was already in the field referred me to his friend, Steven. He is one of the most professional and amazing mentors I have ever had. He has been working in this field since he was 15. He is also a former Google employee. Eventually, after teaching at Berkeley, he found Coding Catalyst to teach full stack JavaScript course. I eventually concluded that taking a course would give me the best results since I did not have background in computer science.

                A former Berkeley graduate, who is currently working at Google told me that there will always be someone bragging about their degree in computer science. Nevertheless, the industry wants people who can actually deliver results, while at the same time learn and advance in their career. With that in mind, I decided to focus on learning the material and master it. Your decision on whether you would benefit from self-studying or joining a bootcamp can be made solely based on the type of a learner you are. Knowing myself and how I usually learn new materials, I decided to sign up to study programming at Coding Catalyst.

            <p class="post-description">
                As much as I believe in self-education, I also believe in good mentorship. I never doubt myself in learning new materials and I know my potential in that; however, a professional mentorship adds more value to your time and education. I find myself lucky to have found a mentor who is caring, professional, and works with me on flexible hours. In conclusion, I suggest everyone to do intensive research and truly observe the material before starting any program. After that, you can choose if self-studying or a joining a bootcamp can help you reach your goal. No matter which path you choose to take, there is always a lot to learn in programming and in the tech industry. Therefore, I must say, self-improvement and self-education will play a bigger role on the long run!
